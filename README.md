This project is a Reddit clone using dummyJSON posts to simulate a blog.

It features functions that allow the user to create blog posts, like & remove them from the page.
All the posts, likes and changes made in the page will be stored using local storage aswell.

The goal of this exercise is to learn DOM-manipulation and further practice the basics of Fetch API.
